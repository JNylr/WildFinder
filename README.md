# GEAR - High Fantasy Extraction Looter

## Overview

**GEAR** is a high-fantasy extraction-based looter that combines the intense, mission-driven gameplay of *Helldivers* and *Arc Raiders* with the vibrant, fluid combat of *Wildstar* and *Wayfinder*. Team up with friends, dive into dangerous realms, defeat powerful enemies, and extract with legendary loot—or lose it all.

## Core Gameplay Loop

### The Extraction Loop

Players embark on **runs** into vast, open fantasy maps filled with danger and opportunity. Each run follows this core loop:

1. **Deploy** - Drop into the map with your team (1-4 players)
2. **Explore** - Navigate the open world, discovering loot caches, hidden areas, and enemy encounters
3. **Combat** - Engage enemies and bosses using fluid, skill-based combat
4. **Collect** - Gather randomized loot from defeated enemies, treasure chests, and searchable locations
5. **Extract** - Successfully leave the map with your hard-earned gear, or...
6. **Die & Drop** - Fall in battle and lose all equipped loot from the current run

### High-Stakes Risk/Reward

Death has consequences. When you or your party is defeated, **all loot currently equipped or carried is dropped**. However, a potential **retrieval system** may allow players to drop back into the map for a high-risk rescue mission to recover their lost gear.

## Character Progression

### Specialized Roles

Players can specialize into distinct combat roles, each with unique abilities and playstyles:

- **Tank** - Frontline defenders who draw aggro and protect the team
- **DPS (Damage Dealer)** - High-damage specialists focused on eliminating threats quickly
- **Healer** - Support role that keeps the team alive through healing and buffs
- **Additional Roles** - *(To be expanded: crowd control, ranged specialists, hybrid classes)*

Each role will have unique skill trees, abilities, and equipment tailored to their playstyle.

### Gear Crafting & Upgrading

- **Craft gear** from materials and loot collected during runs
- **Upgrade equipment** to enhance stats, unlock new abilities, and improve effectiveness
- **Customize builds** to match your preferred playstyle and role
- Gear progression is essential for taking on tougher content and more dangerous bosses

### Base Building & Progression

Your **base** serves as your hub between runs and a key progression system:

- **Level up your base** to unlock access to more powerful crafting recipes
- **Upgrade facilities** to craft higher-tier weapons, armor, and consumables
- **Unlock new tiers** of equipment needed to challenge the most dangerous bosses
- Base progression gates access to end-game content, creating a meaningful long-term goal

## Combat System

### Fluid, Skill-Based Combat

Combat is designed to feel **responsive, dynamic, and satisfying**:

- **Balanced pacing** - Not too fast to be chaotic, not too slow to feel sluggish
- **Smooth animations** - Seamless transitions between attacks, dodges, and abilities
- **Skill expression** - Rewarding player timing, positioning, and decision-making
- **Team synergy** - Roles complement each other, encouraging coordinated play

The combat system draws inspiration from action-oriented MMOs, emphasizing player skill and teamwork over simple stat checks.

## World & Content

### Dynamic Open Maps

- **Large, explorable environments** filled with diverse biomes and landmarks
- **Randomized loot spawns** ensure every run feels different
- **Scalable difficulty** - Harder zones contain tougher enemies and better rewards
- **Boss encounters** - Epic battles against powerful foes that drop rare, high-tier loot

### Loot System

- **Randomized drops** - Every run offers different loot opportunities
- **Tiered rarity** - Common to Legendary gear with increasing power and unique effects
- **Searchable containers** - Chests, crates, and hidden caches scattered throughout the world
- **Boss-specific loot** - Unique items and materials from defeating challenging bosses

## Multiplayer

- **1-4 Player Co-op** - Solo or team up with friends
- **Role composition matters** - Balanced teams have better survival chances
- **Shared loot** - Team-based loot distribution (details TBD)
- **Communication & coordination** - Essential for tackling harder content

## Development Vision

### Current Status
🚧 **In Development** - Core systems and gameplay mechanics are being prototyped and refined.

### Key Pillars

1. **Meaningful Risk** - The extraction loop creates tension and makes success feel rewarding
2. **Fluid Combat** - Every fight should feel responsive, fair, and skill-based
3. **Build Diversity** - Multiple viable builds and playstyles for each role
4. **Progression Depth** - Long-term goals through base building, gear crafting, and character advancement
5. **Replayability** - Randomized loot and dynamic encounters keep runs fresh

## Design Philosophy

**GEAR** aims to capture the adrenaline rush of extraction shooters while delivering the fantasy combat experience of action MMOs. Every decision—when to push deeper, when to extract, which boss to challenge—carries weight. Success requires skill, teamwork, and smart risk management.

The game respects player time by offering meaningful progression even in failed runs (materials for crafting), while rewarding bold plays with rare loot and powerful gear.
